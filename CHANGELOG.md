# NH Changelog

## 4.0.2

### Added

- Add `--json` to `nh search`, which will return results in JSON format. Useful
  for parsing the output of `nh search` with, e.g., jq.

## 4.0.1

### Removed

- NixOS 24.05 is now marked as deprecated, and will emit an error if the search
  command attempts to use it for the channel. While the Elasticsearch backend
  still seems to support 24.05, it is deprecated in Nixpkgs and is actively
  discouraged. Please update your system at your earliest convenience.
